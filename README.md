# Inventory-Management-System-Project
I developed this Inventory Management System Application using Visual Basic Language on dot net platform.

This is my one of Visual Basic project on inventory management system app that I have created during my internship program at "Google Computers Dapoli". The owner of this shop was facing this problem of maintaing inventory or stock so based on that I detected their problem and decide to build a application that will help them to manage their inventory as much as possible.

This application is created by using "Visual Basic" language and I am managing its data using "Microsoft SQL Server" on local database.

There are basically 4 modules :
1. LOGIN
2. INVENTORY
3. STOCK
4. CUSTOMER 

The application provides some good features to manage inventory like add product, search a product, update product and delete product then we can also add customers, search for customer, update and delete them. so it helps a lot to the owners of shops to manage thier data instead of conventional method.
